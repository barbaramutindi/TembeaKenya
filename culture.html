The evolution of traditional music


African music has undergone frequent 
and decisive changes throughout the centuries. 
What is termed traditional music today is very different from African music
 in former times. In the past, tunes and rhythms were not rigidly linked to 
 specific ethnic groups. Through migrations, different ethnic groups borrowed 
 musical styles and instruments, while individual groups' creativity and
 style continued to play an important role in the evolution of music.

            Here in Kenya,we have a
 
            range of different
             
            cultures.Here at TEMBEA 
            
            KENYA,we believe that the 
            
            beauty of the world lies in the 
            
            diversity of its people.
           </p>
           <p>Lamu <br> Lamu is like the pretty little bow that wraps up an entire Muslim region. 
               This semi-remote location has seen very little impact from the outside world 
               and cultures. A traditionally Muslim town, Lamu is as beautiful as it is 
               authentic. As an ‘outsider’ you will be surprised to find that Dhows and donkeys 
               the only mode of transportation here. Spend your time walking through the narrow
               reets, mingle with the locals and when you get tired of that,
                take a dhow to some of the most beautiful and unspoilt beaches on nearby 
                islands such as Kiwayu that make up the Lamu Archipelago. 
                You can also swim with the dolphins in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean  
            
            (learn a little about life as a dolphin from these intelligent creatures).</p> <br>
            <p> Kenya national Archives <br> Right in the city of Nairobi, these two destinations act as a collection 
                point for everything that Kenya has to offer. At the National Archives, 
                you will find records on all the tribes, traditions and Kenyan ways conceivable.
                 At the National Museums of Kenya, you will get to see some of the best art and 
                 show of culture from various local tribes and artists. 
                Visiting these two places is like taking a ‘crash-course’ in ‘Kenyan’!</p>
           
                <p>Theme Nights in Carnivore<br>The Carnivore restaurant is successfully 
                    trying out and implementing an exemplary tradition. They regularly 
                    organize theme nights for different tribes within the Country. 
                    From Luo Night, to Luhya Night, Kamba Night, Kalenjin, Kikuyu and a host of
                     other tribe themed nights. This initiative has proven very successful and 
                     actually good for the peace within the country. On specific theme nights, 
                     
                     anyone is welcome, but you will find nothing else other than traditional foods, 
                     brews, dances and music of the specific tribe honoured with the particular theme
                      night. It is one of the best ways to experience various Kenyan
                     tribes and cultures while having fun and dancing the night away.</p>

            Language is the road  map of aculture.
            It tells you where its people come from and where they are going.
            At TEMBEA KENYA,we are excited to

         <p>Kiswahili language <br>
            One of the truly beautiful things about languages is that
             they have rich and sometimes surprising histories. <br>
             This is true for so-called ‘dialects’ of languages too. <br>
             Too often we fail to stop and think about the birth of various 
             languages and how those languages spread to the regions they inhabit today. <br>
              Kiswahili is a very interesting language historically, and there is wide 
              debate on the historical
             and linguistic circumstances concerning its birth. </p>
